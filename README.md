# R-Classes at USF
Both courses aim to teach undergraduate and graduate students, across disciplines, how to use Open-Source R for data science professionals. 
Students will become proficient in error handling/debugging to develop efficient and functional R programs. Because this is a undergraduate-level course, mastering the fundamentals just marks the beginning of the journey.
